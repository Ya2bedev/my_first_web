        Hi, I am a web developer and I am making this website for me. I love
        programming and designing and that is why I want to be a web developer.
        Programming languages are my favorite part of the job, I find them
        interesting and easy to learn. Web development is where my heart lies, I
        like how it challenges me in various ways. I want to be a web developer.
        One of the things that I love about being a web developer is the
        flexibility and control over your development environment. I started
        developing websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my own time. That
        turned into building my first website for a friend one day, which I
        decided to open source on GitHub as I had just learned how to use Git. A
        few months after that I got offered an apprenticeship at a company where
        they would pay me while they teach me how to be a web developer –
        something that I never thought was possible before because it’s so
        expensive and most bootcamps are fulltime commitments. Not only did they
        give me the opportunity to learn about career possibilities in the
        industry but now I have job security for life.
